# Dissolved-Organic-Matter
Welcome to the Dissolved Organic Matter Team!

## Research Advisor:
Katrina Chen (kc778)

## Subteam Lead: 
Rachel Lai (rml267)

## Team Members:
Nhi Nguyen (npn25)

Zach Kwon (zk49)

Brooke Paykin (bsp67)

## Semester Goals:
The goal of the Dissolved Organic Matter subteam is to determine the optimal coagulant dosage to remove humic acid from influent water with low turbidity, and experiment with activated carbon as a supplement for coagulant. The team is ready to start experimenting at varying pH levels, clay concentrations, temperatures, and humic acid concentrations to find optimal coagulant dosings in different situations.
