# Dissolved-Organic-Matter
Welcome to the Dissolved Organic Matter Team!

## Research Advisor:

## Semester Goals:
The goal of the Dissolved Organic Matter subteam is to determine the optimal dosages for clay and/or activated carbon to remove humic acid (a form of dissolved organic matter) from influent water with low turbidity. The team performs experiments by varying clay and/or activated carbon mass flow rates with ProCoDA to determine optimal dosages for each and test which is the better alternative for removing DOM from drinking water.
